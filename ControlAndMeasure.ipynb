You'll be using [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) to drive the `pin-17` terminal (labelled `Vdac` in the schematic) and collect data from the `pin-15` and `pin-10` terminals (labelled `adc1` and `adc2` in the schematic).\n",

    "You'll notice that there's a capacitor in the circuit. For the first experiment, we'll drive the circuit very slowly, so that the capacitor plays no role. Later, we'll consider the transient behavior of the circuit and you'll see that the capacitor can have a dramatic effect."

    "[CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) is a version of python that runs on small micro-controllers. It has many of the features of the python language you probably learned before, but it includes libraries that enable one to control and measure voltages on the input and output pins of the micro-controller. To program the microcontroller you'll need to take several steps.\n",

    "Once the code is complete, you can press the `reset` button on the microcontroller. This will momentarily disconnect and remount the filesystem of the device. Note: the filesystem is mounted \"read only\" to your computer. This means that you cannot make changes to the filesystem from the file manager of the computer. Only the microcontroller can change the filesystem. Thonny is connected to the microcontroller software, so thonny ask the microcontroller to save updates to the files on the filesystem for you. To see changes to the filesystem from the computer file manager, you need to remount the filesystem, which requires a reset. Once you reset the device you can copy the `csv` file with the measured values to the project folder for analysis."
