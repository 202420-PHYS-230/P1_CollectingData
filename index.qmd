# Template

## (Delete this section when you commit your report)

For each project there'll be a template like this. I'll try to make the early templates more of a "fill in the blank" experience, but as the semester progresses you'll be seeing less and less scaffolding and more of bare bones layout with a lot of room for creativity and flexibility. The rubric will remain consistent for all the projects. When you are ready to commit your final report, you can delete this cell, and any other cells that are purely made up of instructions or guidance, and leave only the cells that belong in the final report.

This doument is a [Quarto](https://quarto.org) markdown document. We're using Quarto in this class to prepare project reports. It has some nice features that make it well suited to this sort of task. For example it's easy to pull a graph from a notebook like this:

{{< embed ExampleLinearFit.ipynb#curve_fit_example >}}

It's easy to embed math, like this: $x=\sin(3t + \phi)$, right in your prose. You can also embed images that you've created and saved:

![Fig. 1: The external circuit we used to implement a voltage divider and an RC circuit.](images/divider.png){fig-align="left" width="557"}

Further, if you have a table of data that makes sense to include, that's also easy to do:

{{< embed ExampleLinearFit.ipynb#read_data >}}

The report should have 5 sections:

1. Abstract and Description
    * An abstract is a very brief statment of what was measured and the results produced. In the best case, there should be an estimate of uncertainty as well.
    * The description is a more in-depth explanation of the experiments done, but without the result. This is not a "procedure," but simply an explanation of what was accomplished, and roughly how it was done.
2. Schematic and Background
    * A circuit schematic of each experiment. 
    * Any background information needed to understand the circuits.
3. Function/Data Collection
    * This is where you explain how you know the circuit functioned correctly.
    * What data did you collect?
    * How did you validate it?
4. Results
    * Analysis of data collected in part 3 to infer the values from the abstract.
    * If there are statistical exercises in this project, you'll post the answers as a part of this section. Please state the question, and provide the solution. 
5. Conclusion
    * A summary of your inferences.

Now it's time for the actual report. Delete everything above the line below, including the line! Within the report itself, all you need to do is to perform the actual experiments and replace both the data, and the results, with the actual data you collect, and the actual results you produce using that data. This week most of the work of writing, coding, and analyzing has already been done. All you need to do is to replace the sample data with real data. This is deliberately done so you'll have a concrete example of how to proceed in future weeks.

# 1. Abstract and Description

## Abstract

We measured the voltage at two points in a resistor network to estimate the value of one resistor relative to another. We found the ratio of voltages was: $0.665\pm 0.001$ giving a resistance for $R_2$ of  $\approx 1982\pm18\mathrm{~\Omega}$. We also measured the decay over time of the voltage on a capacitor. We used that to estimate the capacitance, and found it to be $C \approx 99.8 \pm 0.5\mathrm{~\mu F}$. (Please replace these numbers with numbers from  your analysis. Then delete this parenthetical comment.)

## Description

The intention of this project is to be simple enough that the electrical circuits are not confusing or difficult, but authentic in the sense that we're collecting real data and doing legitimate analysis of that data to produce results.

The project invoves two experiments. 

1. We'll drive a resistor network and measure voltages in that network to make inferences. In particular we'll assume we "know" the resistance of one of the resistors to infer the resistance of the other resistor.
2. We'll monitor the voltage across a capacitor over time to infer the value of its capacitance assuming we know the resistance of the resistors through which the capacitor is discharged.

# 2. Schematic and Background

Both measurements for this week use the same schemtic:

In most projects you'll have some design decisions to make to choose devices and component values to produce a working circuit. In those cases this is where you'd describe those decisions and explain how to made them. This week the circuit is provided "as-is", so there are no design decisions to make, and no explanation is needed.

For experiment 1 we'll use the DAC to drive pin 17 with ever increasing voltages. At the same time we'll be measuring the voltages at pins 15 and 10. So long as the voltages change slowly enough that the capacitor can fully charge between measurements, the voltage at pin 10 (adc2) should be proportional to the voltage at pin 15 (adc1) according to the standard voltage divider relationship:

$$ v_2 = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} v_1 $$

By driving and measuring $v_1$ and also measuring $v_2$, we can
